## Setting up a development environment

1. **Prerequisites**

   * Docker & Docker Compose
   * Python 3.12 installed (for running tests locally)
2. **Clone repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/book-club-bot.git
   cd book-club-bot
   ```
3. **Environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following keys:

   ```dotenv
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_token
   BOOKCLUB_CHANNEL_ID=1234567890
   BOOKCLUB_NOM_CHANNEL_ID=1234567891
   BOOKCLUB_RESULTS_CHANNEL_ID=1234567892

   DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pwd@db/bot
   REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
   PREDICTIONS_CHANNEL_ID=1234567893
   ```
4. **Start services**

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
5. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   docker compose exec bot pytest --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings -q
   ```

## Git hooks

Install the provided pre-commit hook so commits run the unit test suite automatically.

```bash
uv tool run pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit
```

The hook runs `uv run pytest tests` on each commit. Set `SKIP=unit-tests` when committing if you need to bypass it temporarily. The hook pins `UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache` so it can write inside the repo sandbox.

## Contributing
